# AFOLU Tool

The **Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)-tool** is designed to assist policymakers and planners in developing medium- and long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) non-energy emission scenarios for agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. 

This tool is integrated into the **Long-term Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP)** platform, which is currently used by over 60,000 users to create medium- and long-term energy systems and GHG emission trajectories. Together, LEAP and the AFOLU tool enable the development of internally consistent energy and non-energy GHG emission reduction strategies.

## Features

- **GHG Emissions Estimation**  
  The AFOLU tool facilitates the estimation of methane (CH₄), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from:
  - Livestock management
  - Soil management
  - Forestry, other land use and land-use change

- **Adaptable Model**  
  The tool comes in the form of a LEAP model for non-energy-related GHG emissions from agriculture and FOLU based on a hypothetical  country with dry temperate climate and can be easily adapted to specific national geographic and climatic contexts.

- **IPCC-Compliant Methodology**  
  The tool employs the Tier 1 methodology from the **2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories**, ensuring alignment with National GHG inventories and UN Transparency reporting guidelines

- **Scenario-Building Capabilities**  
  Leveraging LEAP's advanced scenario-building features, users can explore various management strategies and prioritize key areas for mitigation action.

## Getting Started

### Download  
The AFOLU tool can be downloaded directly from this GitHub repository.  

### Documentation  
A comprehensive **User Manual** is included to guide users through:  
- Identifying national data requirements  
- Adjusting for context-specific parameters and climate-specific emission factors  

## How It Works  
1. Install [LEAP](https://leap.sei.org).
2. Download the AFOLU tool from this GitHub repository and install in LEAP
3. Configure the model for your specific national or regional context using the provided manual.
4. Build and compare different mitigation scenarios.
