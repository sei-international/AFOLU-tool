# AFOLU Tool Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the AFOLU Tool. This site provides guidance on setting up and using the tool.

The SEI Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)-tool is designed to assist policymakers and planners in developing medium- and long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) non-energy emission scenarios for agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. The tool is integrated into the Long-term Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) platform, which is currently used by over 60,000 users to create medium- and long-term energy systems and GHG emission trajectories.

Together, LEAP and the AFOLU tool enable the development of internally consistent energy and non-energy GHG emission reduction strategies. By leveraging LEAP's scenario-building capabilities, user-friendly interface and reporting capacity, users can explore different management strategies, facilitating the prioritization of key areas for mitigation action. The AFOLU tool applies the Tier 1 methodology in the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories to estimate emissions of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (NOX) emissions, ensuring that mitigation scenarios align with national GHG inventories and transparency reporting guidelines.
