These instructions will guide you through setting up your own model of non-energy GHG emission projections in LEAP using the AFOLU tool. 

This will involve:
- Installing LEAP
- Installing the AFOLU tool
- Setting up an AFOLU model of your national context by:
  - Adapting the tool to your national context using activity data 
  - Updating climate-dependent parameters
- Calibrating to National GHG Inventory
- Building AFOLU mitigation scenarios
