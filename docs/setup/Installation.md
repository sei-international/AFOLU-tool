## Installation of the AFOLU Tool in LEAP

1. **Download the *AFOLU_v$currentversion$.leap file*** from [GitHub](https://github.com/sei-international/AFOLU-tool) and install the tool in your LEAP software.

2. Navigate to the **Downloads** folder (or wherever you saved the *AFOLU.leap* file), and double-click to install in LEAP. Alternatively, you can also select **"Install from file"** from the LEAP software's **Area** menu.

This will open the default AFOLU tool in LEAP. The AFOLU consists of a non-energy LEAP-model  for a hypothetical country with a dry climate, with the following branch structure:

- **Key assumptions**
- **Non-energy**
  - Agriculture
  - LULUCF

*You are now ready to adapt the model to your national or regional context.*
