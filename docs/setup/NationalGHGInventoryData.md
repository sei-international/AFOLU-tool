# Adding National GHG Inventory data

In order to make projections consistent with national inventories that have been developed outside of LEAP, the AFOLU tool allows adding the inventory directly to the AFOLU tool and overwriting bottom-up calculations. 

This is done in the *Current Accounts*-scenario under the *Non Energy*-branch. To add your data:
- Select *Current Accounts* from the Scenarios
- Add historical GHG inventory data under each relevant category:
  - Enteric Fermentation (CH4 emissions)
  - Rice Cultivation (CH4 emissions)
  - Manure Management (CH4 and N2O emissions)
  - Managed Soils (N2O emissions)
  - Urea Application (CO2 emissions)

If you do not add this data, the tool will default to bottom-up calculations of GHG emissions based on Activity data. Calculation will begine in the earliest year for which activity data is available.
