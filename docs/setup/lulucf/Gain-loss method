# The Gain-Loss Method

For the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) category, a Gainâ€“Loss method is applied to track 
emissions and sequestration associated with land use changes and management practices. For forested lands, 
Tier 2 methods are applied, which is essential to account for biomass accumulation as well the impacts of overexploitation 
on total carbon storage in natural and plantation forests. For all other land use categories, Tier 1 methods are used.
